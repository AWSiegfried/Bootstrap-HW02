### Description ###

For this assignment we were asked to create a page that includes a personal contact, portfolio and About Me page.  We were to build and style the pages solely using external Bootstrap styling.  Not using my personal CSS style sheet was easily the biggest obstacle I had to overcome; however, it forced me to really dig into Bootstrap, which I feel will be beneficial anyway.  The biggest revelation I had was seemingly the simplest concept to grasp, and that was that in order to stack classes you don't write "class=" twice.  You just group all the classes you like into the one string.  This made formatting my sheets very simple.  Also, this was the first time that I had ever used an html validator from the web (I used validator.w3.org).  It found very minor errors that seemingly had no effect on the code, but I love that.  Unnecessary things shouldn't be there and the tool found simple mistakes like having two "href=" with the second one leading nowhere.  The two biggest issues I had with this assignment were to make the options on the Navbar go the right, and also wrapping the text around the picture in my About Me.
